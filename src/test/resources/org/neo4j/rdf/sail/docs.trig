		core:title "Anticipatory Robot Control for a Partially Observable Environment Using Episodic Memories"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "This paper explains an episodic-memory based approach for computing anticipatory robot behavior in a partially observable environment. Inspired by biological findings on the mammalian hippocampus, here, the episodic memories retain a sequence of experienced observation, behavior, and reward. Incorporating multiple machine learning methods, this approach attempts to help reducing the computational burden of the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In particular, the proposed computational reduction techniques include: 1) abstraction of the state space via temporal difference learning; 2) abstraction of the action space by utilizing motor schemata; 3) narrowing down the state space in terms of the goals by employing instance-based learning; 4) elimination of the value-iteration by assuming a unidirectional-linear-chaining formation of the state space; 5) reduction of the state-estimate computation by exploiting the property of the Poisson distribution; and 6) trimming the history length by imposing the cap on the number of episodes that are computed. Furthermore, claims 5) and 6) were empirically verified, and it was confirmed that the state estimation can be in fact computed in an O(n) time (where n is the number of the states), more efficient than a conventional Kalman-filter based approach of O(n2).

		core:abstract "In this work, we describe an autonomous mobile robotic system for finding and investigating ambient noise sources in the environment. Motivated by the large negative effect of ambient noise sources on robot audition, the long-term goal is to provide awareness of the auditory scene to a robot, so that it may more effectively act to filter out the interference or re-position itself to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we concentrate on the discovery of new sources of sound through the use of mobility and directed investigation. This is performed in a two-step process. In the first step, a mobile robot first explores the surrounding acoustical environment, creating evidence grid representations to localize the most influential sound sources in the auditory scene. Then in the second step, the robot investigates each potential sound source location in the environment so as to improve the localization result, and identify volume and directionality characteristics of the sound source. Once every source has been investigated, a noise map of the entire auditory scene is created for use by the robot in avoiding areas of loud ambient noise when performing an auditory task.

An example implementation of this strategy applied to the entertainment humanoid robot QRIO is introduced and the results are discussed. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Long-term human-robot interaction, especially in the case of humanoid robots, requires an adaptable and varied behavior base. In this work we present a method for capturing, or learning, sequential tasks by transferring serial behavior execution from deliberative to routine control. The incorporation of this approach leads to natural development of complex and varied behaviors, with lower demands for planning, coordination and resources. We demonstrate how this process can be performed autonomously as part of the normal function of the robot, without the need for an explicit learning stage or user guidance. The complete implementation of this algorithm on the Sony QRIO humanoid robot is described. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "This research details the application of non-verbal communication display behaviors to an autonomous humanoid robot, including the use of proxemics, which to date has been seldom explored in the field of human-robot interaction. In order to allow the robot to communicate information non-verbally while simultaneously fulfilling its existing instrumental behavior, a behavioral overlay model that encodes this data onto the robots pre-existing motor expression is developed and presented. The state of the robots system of internal emotions and motivational drives is used as the principal data source for non-verbal expression, but in order for the robot to display this information in a natural and nuanced fashion, an additional para-emotional framework has been developed to support the individuality of the robots interpersonal relationships with humans and of the robot itself. An implementation on the Sony QRIO is described which overlays QRIOs existing EGO architecture and situated schema-based behaviors with a mechanism for communicating this framework through modalities that encompass posture, gesture and the management of interpersonal distance.

Our previous research has studied the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) tools to assist a user in the generation of multi-robot missions. These tools, however, typically assume that the robots available for the mission are of the same type (i.e., homogeneous). We loosen this assumption through the integration of contract-net protocol (CNP) based task allocation coupled with a CBR-based mission specification wizard. Two alternative designs are explored for combining case based mission specification and CNP-based team allocation as well as the tradeoffs that result from the selection of one of these approaches over the other.

		core:title "Biasing Behavioral Activation with Intent"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Deliberate control of an entertainment robot presents a special problem in balancing the requirement for intentional behavior with the existing mechanisms for autonomous action selection. We propose that the intentional biasing of activation in lower-level reactive behaviors is the proper mechanism for realizing such deliberative action. In addition, we suggest that directed intentional bias could result in goal-oriented behavior without subsuming the underlying action selection used to generate natural behavior. This objective is realized through a structure called the intentional bus. The intentional bus serves as the interface between deliberative and reactive control by realizing high-level goals through the modulation of intentional signals sent to the reactive layer. A deliberative architecture that uses the intentional bus to realize planned behavior is described. In addition, it is shown how the intentional bus framework can be expanded to support the serialization of planned behavior by shifting from direct intentional influence for plan execution to attentional triggering of a learned action sequence. Finally, an implementation of this architecture, developed and tested on Sony's humanoid robot QRIO, is described. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Though attention to evaluating human-robot interfaces has increased in recent years, there are relatively few reports of using evaluation tools during the development of human-robot interaction (HRI) systems to gauge and improve their designs possibly due to a shortage of suitable evaluation techniques. Heuristic evaluation is a technique suitable for such applications that has become popular in the human-computer interaction (HCI) community. However, it requires usability heuristics applicable to the system environment. This work contributes a set of heuristics appropriate for use with HRI systems, derived from a variety of sources both in and out of the HRI field. Evaluators have successfully used the heuristics on an HRI system, demonstrating their effectiveness against standard measures of heuristic effectiveness.

This work is based on interdependence theory, a social psychological theory of interaction and social situation analysis. We use interdependence theory to garner information about the social situations involving a human and a robot. We also quantify the gain in outcome resulting from situation analysis. Experiments demonstrate the utility of social situation information and of our situation-based framework as a method for guiding robot interaction. We conclude that this framework offers a principled, general approach for studying interactive robotics problems. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Illusion versus Reality in Companion Robots: A Reprise"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Serving as a consultant for Sony Corporation for nearly 10 years in the development of software for the AIBO and QRIO entertainment robots has provided key insights into the development of machines intended to serve as human companions, both from an understanding of human psychology and nascent robotics technology. One intent of robots of this ilk is to tap into the rich vein of a persons ability to bond with non-human artifacts [Reeves and Nass 96], with the deliberate goal of providing long-term satisfying h uman-robot interaction. Insights towards achieving this end can be gleaned from a broad range of scientific communities including human ethology, sociology, psychology, and of course the field of human-robot interaction itself. Most robotics researchers view this expanding area as an innocuous and even beneficial use of robots, possibly for the treatment of isolated elderly people, e.g., including robots such as Paro, and its &quot;cousins&quot;. But not all agree. This research requires a deep understanding of not only a robot's capabilities but also human psychology, where the roboticists intention is to induce pleasant psychological states in the observer/partner through specialized patterns of robot behavior and, to the greatest extent possible, to suspend the observer's disbelief by creating an illusion that the robot is seemingly alive. Specialized methods to address possible boredom in the user [Csikszentmihalyi 00], to display suitable affectionate behavior using kinesics and proxemics [Brooks and Arkin 07] or to utilize developmental robotic approaches [Weng 01] can potentially lead to the elaboration of complex and learned behavior that can all support this illusion. Even computational models of love, attachment, and friendship [e.g., Fraley and Shaver 00, Hazan and Shaver 87, Kanda and Ishiguro 04] can conceivably be brought to bear as robots move closer towards achieving intimate relationships with people. The end goal remains to establish a long-term, even lifelong, human-robot relationship. Some view this type of research as no different than that of cinema, video games, or other forms of entertainment. Others (e.g., [Sparrow 02, Sparrow and Sparrow 06, Morgan 07])a rgue that this is an intrusion into the rights of the elderly to remain in contact with the real world, where society abrogates its responsibility to their citizens, while researchers, such as myself, make excuses for its potentially deliberate unethical use, even at times hiding behind arguments based upon cultural differences and looming labor shortages. Often even alternatives that potentially favor our underlying societal responsibilities towards one another are not even considered or forwarded as viable alternatives by roboticists. This presentation reviews the underlying arguments and counterarguments surrounding certain ethical claims regarding robotic companions, with respect to the existing aims and results of such research endeavors.

		core:title "ACOUSTICAL AWARENESS FOR INTELLIGENT ROBOTIC ACTION"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "With the growth of successes in pattern recognition and signal processing, mobile robot applications today are increasingly equipping their hardware with microphones to improve the set of available sensory information. However, if the robot, and therefore the microphone, ends up in a poor location acoustically, then the data will remain noisy and potentially useless for accomplishing the required task. This is compounded by the fact that there are many bad acoustic locations through which a robot is likely to pass, and so the results from auditory sensors often remain poor for much of the task. The movement of the robot, though, can also be an important tool for overcoming these problems, a tool that has not been exploited in the traditional signal processing community. Robots are not limited to a single location as are traditionally placed microphones, nor are they powerless over to where they will be moved as with wearable computers. If there is a better location available for performing its task, a robot can navigate to that location under its own power. Furthermore, when deciding where to move, robots can develop complex models of the environment. Using an array of sensors, a mobile robot can build models of sound flow through an area, picking from those models the paths most likely to improve performance of an acoustic application. In this dissertation, we address the question of how to exploit robotic movement. Using common sensors, we present a collection of tools for gathering information about the auditory scene and incorporating that information into a general framework for acoustical awareness. Thus equipped, robots can make intelligent decisions regarding control strategies to enhance their performance on the underlying acoustic application. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Biasing Behavioral Activation with Intent for an Entertainment Robot"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Deliberate control of an entertainment robot presents a special problem in balancing the requirement for intentional behavior with the existing mechanisms for autonomous action selection. We propose that the intentional biasing of activation in lower-level reactive behaviors is the proper mechanism for realizing such deliberative action. In addition, we suggest that directed intentional bias can result in goal-oriented behavior without subsuming the underlying action selection used to generate natural behavior. This objective is realized through a structure called the intentional bus. The intentional bus serves as the interface between deliberative and reactive control by realizing high-level goals through the modulation of intentional signals sent to the reactive layer. A deliberative architecture that uses the intentional bus to realize planned behavior is described. In addition, it is shown how the intentional bus framework can be expanded to support the serialization of planned behavior by shifting from direct intentional influence for plan execution to attentional triggering of a learned action sequence. Finally, an implementation of this architecture, developed and tested on Sonys humanoid robot QRIO, is described. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Modeling Robot Differences by Leveraging A Physically Shared Context"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Knowledge sharing, either implicit or explicit, is crucial during development as evidenced by many studies into the transfer of knowledge by teachers via gaze following and learning by imitation. In the future, the teacher of one robot may be a more experienced robot. There are many new difficulties, however, with regard to knowledge transfer among robots that develop embodiment-specific knowledge through individual solo interaction with the world. This is especially true for heterogeneous robots, where perceptual and motor capabilities may differ. In this paper, we propose to leverage similarity, in the form of a physically shared context, to learn models of the differences between two robots. The second contribution we make is to analyze the cost and accuracy of several methods for the establishment of the physically shared context with respect to such modeling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods in a simulated domain involving shared attention of an object. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "We present a novel framework for learning crosssensory and sensorimotor correlations in order to detect and localize faults in mobile robots. Unlike traditional fault detection and identification schemes, we do not use a priori models of fault states or system dynamics. Instead, we utilize additional information and possible source of redundancy that mobile robots have available to them, namely a hierarchical graph representing stages of sensory processing at multiple levels of abstractions and their outputs. We learn statistical models of correlations between elements in the hierarchy, in addition to the control signals, and use this to detect and identify changes in the capabilities of the robot. The framework is instantiated using Self-Organizing Maps, a simple unsupervised learning algorithm. Results indicate that the system can detect sensory and motor faults in a mobile robot and identify their cause, without using a priori models of the robot or its fault states.

Experiments demonstrate the utility of the information provided by the situation analysis algorithm and of the value of this method for guiding robot interaction. We conclude that the situation analysis algorithm offers a viable, principled, and general approach to explore interactive robotics problems. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "In this paper, we report on the integration challenges of the various component technologies developed towards the establishment of a framework for deploying an adaptive system of heterogeneous robots for urban surveillance. In our integrated experiment and demonstration, aerial robots generate maps that are used to design navigation controllers and plan missions for the team. A team of ground robots constructs a radio signal strength map that is used as an aid for planning missions. Multiple robots establish a mobile, ad-hoc communication network that is aware of the radio signal strength between nodes and can adapt to changing conditions to maintain connectivity. Finally, the team of aerial and ground robots is able to monitor a small village, and search for and localize human targets by the color of the uniform, while ensuring that the information from the team is available to a remotely located human operator. The key component technologies and contributions include (a) mission specication and planning software; (b) exploration and mapping of radio signal strengths in an urban environment; (c) programming abstractions and composition of controllers for multi-robot deployment; (d) cooperative control strategies for search, identication, and localization of targets; and (e) three-dimensional mapping in an urban setting.

		core:abstract "A new interfacing method is presented to control mobile robot(s) in a supervised manner. Mobile robots often provide global position information to an operator. This research describes a method whereby the operator controls a mobile robot(s) using his finger or stylus via a touchpad or touchscreen interface. Using a mapping between the robots operational site and the input device, a human user can provide routing information for the mobile robot. Two algorithms have been developed to create the robot trajectory from the operators input. Information regarding numerous path points is generated when the operator moves his finger/stylus. To prune away meaningless point information, a simple but powerful significant points extracting algorithm is developed. The resulting ignificant points are used as waypoints. An on-line piecewise cubic Bezier curves (PCBC) trajectory generation algorithm is presented to create a smooth trajectory for these significant points. As the method is based on distance and not on time, the velocity of mobile robot can be controlled easily within its allowable dynamic range. The PCBC trajectory can also be modified on the fly. Simulation results are presented to verify these newly developed methods. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "This article investigates the commonalities between motivations and emotions as evidenced in a broad range of animal models, including humans. In particular, a focus is placed on how these models can have utility within the context of working robotic systems. Behavior-based control serves as the primary vehicle through which emotions and motivations are integrated into robots ranging from hexapods to wheeled robots to humanoids. Starting from relatively low-level organisms, such as the sowbug and praying mantis, and then moving upward to human interactions, a progression of motivational/emotional models and robotic experiments is reported. These capture a wide set of affective phenomena including social attachment, emotional behavior in support of interspecies interaction, multiscale temporal affect, and various motivational drives such as hunger and fear.

		core:abstract "We introduce the Marco Polo Localization approach, where we apply sound as a tool for gathering range measurements between robots, and use those to solve a range-only Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem. Range is calculated by correlating two recordings of the same sound, recorded on a pair of robots, after which the resulting time delay estimate is converted to a range measurement. The algorithmic approach we use is a straightforward application of the Bayesian estimation framework. We also present two complementary views on the associated optimization problem that provide insight into the problem and allows one to devise initialization strategies, indispensable in a range-only scenario. We illustrate the approach with both simulated and experimental results. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

We develop what is essentially a straightforward application of Bayesian estimation to the problem, and present two complimentary views on the associated optimization problem that provide insight into the problem and allows one to devise initialization strategies, indispensable in practice. We also provide a discussion of the degrees of freedom and ambiguities in the solution.

		core:abstract "We describe a multiple hypothesis particle filter for tracking targets that will be influenced by the proximity and/or behavior of other targets. Our contribution is to show how a Markov random field motion prior, built on the fly at each time step, can model these interactions to enable more accurate tracking. We present results for a social insect tracking application, where we model the domain knowledge that two targets cannot occupy the same space, and targets will actively avoid collisions. We show that using this model improves track quality and efficiency. Unfortunately, the joint particle tracker we propose suffers from exponential complexity in the number of tracked targets. An approximation to the joint filter, however, consisting of multiple nearly independent particle filters can provide similar track quality at substantially lower computational cost.

		core:abstract "Ad-hoc networks among groups of autonomous mobile robots are becoming a common occurrence as teams of robots take on increasingly complicated mission over wider areas. Research has often focused on proactive means in which the individual robots of the team may prevent communication failures between nodes in this network. This is not always possible especially in unknown or hostile environments. This research addresses reactive aspects of communication recovery. How should the members of the team react in the event of unseen communication failures between some or all of the nodes in the network? We present a number of behaviors to be utilized in the event of communications failure as well as a behavioral sequencer to further enhance the effectiveness of these recovery behaviors. The performance of the communication recovery behaviors is analyzed in simulation and their application on hardware platforms is discussed. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Autonomous teams of robots operating in a dynamic, adversarial environment stand to benefit from using all available resources. But how can knowledge be used to construct a plan that does not interfere with the robots ability to react to its environment? In this research we distill abstract representation into a plan usable by a reactive behavior-based architecture. This plan is then exploited to enhance the performance of a team of robots tasked with maintaining communications while performing reconnaissance. Utilizing multiple plans in serial and in parallel is shown via simulation to be a promising method for increasing mission performance. We conclude that the utility of these internalized plans warrants further investigation as a method for imbuing reactive agents with a priori knowledge. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "This paper presents a method for a mobile robot to construct and localize relative to a cognitive map, where the cognitive map is assumed to be a representational structure that encodes both spatial and behavioral information. The localization is performed by applying a generic Bayes filter. The cognitive map was implemented within a behavior-based robotic system, providing a new behavior that allows the robot to anticipate future events using the cognitive map. One of the prominent advantages of this approach is elimination of the pose sensor usage (e.g., shaft encoder, compass, GPS, etc.), which is known for its limitations and proneness to various errors. A preliminary experiment was conducted in simulation and its promising results are discussed. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "In this paper, we describe a reactive robot architecture that uses fast re-planning methods to avoid the shortcomings of reactive navigation, such as getting stuck in box canyons or in front of small openings. Our robot architecture differs from others in that it gives planning progressively greater control of the robot if reactive navigation continues to fail, until planning controls the robot directly. Our first experiments on a Nomad robot and in simulation demonstrate that our robot architecture promises to simplify the programming of reactive robot architectures greatly and results in robust navigation, smooth trajectories, and reasonably good navigation performance.

		core:abstract "This paper introduces a novel approach to representing and learning tool affordances by a robot. The tool representation described here uses a behavior-based approach to ground the tool affordances in the behavioral repertoire of the robot. The representation is learned during a behavioral babbling stage in which the robot randomly chooses different exploratory behaviors, applies them to the tool, and observes their effects on environmental objects. The paper shows how the autonomously learned affordance representation can be used to solve tool-using tasks by dynamically sequencing the exploratory behaviors based on their expected outcomes. The quality of the learned representation was tested on extension of- reach tool-using tasks. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Noise Maps for Acoustically Sensitive Navigation"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "More and more robotic applications are equipping robots with microphones to improve the sensory information available to them. However, in most applications the auditory task is very low-level, only processing data and providing auditory event information to higher-level navigation routines. If the robot, and therefore the microphone, ends up in a bad acoustic location, then the results from that sensor will remain noisy and potentially useless for accomplishing the required task. To solve this problem, there are at least two possible solutions. The first is to provide bigger and more complex filters, which is the traditional signal processing approach. An alternative solution is to move the robot in concert with providing better audition. In this work, the second approach is followed by introducing noise maps as a tool for acoustically sensitive navigation. A noise map is a guide to noise in the environment, pinpointing locations, which would most likely interfere with auditory sensing. A traditional noise map, in an acoustic sense, is a graphical display of the average sound pressure level at any given location. An area with high sound pressure level corresponds to high ambient noise that could interfere with an auditory application. Such maps can be either created by hand, or by allowing the robot to first explore the environment. Converted into a potential field, a noise map then becomes a useful tool for reducing the interference from ambient noise. Preliminary results with a real robot on the creation and use of noise maps are presented. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Previously, we have introduced an anticipatory robot that could generate a cognitive map while simultaneously localizing itself relative to it. Inspired by recent hippocampal research, there, we demonstrated that the robot could exhibit anticipatory behavior if episodic memories that encode both spatial/nonspatial stimuli and behavioral actions are adequately utilized. In this paper, we will propose various ways to improve the previous method. For example, to address the computational complexity problem observed in the previous method, we will incorporate a new internal state variable inspired by the somatic marker hypothesis (a biological premise that speculates the role of emotional responses in our brain in terms of memory and decision making). Furthermore, we conjecture that this framework for anticipation can be even extended farther for a robot to deal with a novel situation (i.e., improvisation). We will discuss the concept of our improvisational robot in terms of anticipatory failures and their possible solutions. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Spatio-Temporal Case-Based Reasoning for Efficient Reactive Robot Navigation"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "This paper presents an approach to automatic selection and modification of behavioral assemblage parameters for autonomous navigation tasks. The goal of this research is to make obsolete the task of manual configuration of behavioral parameters, which often requires significant knowledge of robot behavior and extensive experimentation, and to increase the efficiency of robot navigation by automatically choosing and finetuning the parameters that fit the robot task-environment well in real-time. The method is based on the Case-Based Reasoning paradigm. Derived from incoming sensor data, this approach computes spatial features of the environment. Based on the robots performance, emporal features of the environment are then computed. Both sets of features are then used to select and finetune a set of parameters for an active behavioral assemblage. By continuously monitoring the sensor data and performance of the robot, the method reselects these parameters as necessary. While a mapping from environmental features onto behavioral parameters, i.e., the cases, can be hard-coded, a method for learning new and optimizing existing cases is also presented. This completely automates the process of behavioral parameterization. The system was integrated within a hybrid robot architecture and extensively evaluated using simulations and indoor and outdoor real world robotic experiments in multiple environments and sensor modalities, clearly demonstrating the benefits of the approach.

		core:abstract "This paper describes a usability study designed to assess ease of use, user satisfaction, and performance of a mobile robot mission specification system. The software under consideration, MissionLab , allows users to specify a robot mission as well as compile it, execute it, and control the robot in real-time. In this work, a new automated mission repair mechanism that aids users in correcting faulty missions was added to the system. This mechanism was compared to an older version in order to better inform the development process, and set a direction for future improvements in usability.

		core:abstract "This paper investigates the problem of user interface design and evaluation for autonomous teams of heterogeneous mobile robots. We explore an operator modeling approach to multi-robot user interface evaluation. Specifically the authors generated GOMS models, a type of user model, to investigate potential interface problems and to guide the interface development process. Results indicate that our interface design changes improve the usability of multi-robot mission generation substantially. We conclude that modeling techniques such as GOMS can play an important role in robotic interface development. Moreover, this research indicates that these techniques can be performed in an inexpensive and timely manner, potentially reducing the need for costly and demanding usability studies.

		core:title "An Empirical Evaluation of Context-Sensitive Pose Estimators in an Urban Outdoor Environment"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "When a mobile robot is executing a navigational task in an urban outdoor environment, accurate localization information is often essential. The difficulty of this task is compounded by sensor drop-out and the presence of non-linear error sources over the span of the mission. We have observed that certain motions of the robot and environmental conditions affect pose sensors in different ways. In this paper, we propose a computational method for localization that systematically integrates and evaluates contextual information that affects the quality of sensors, and utilize the information in order to improve the output of sensor fusion. Our method was evaluated in comparison with conventional probabilistic localization methods (namely, the extended Kalman filter and Monte Carlo localization) in a set of outdoor experiments. The results of the experiment are also reported in this paper. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Value-Based Communication Preservation (VBCP) is a behavior-based, computationally efficient approach to maintaining line-of-sight RF communication between members of robot teams in the context of other tasks. The goal of VBCP is, at each time step, to reactively choose a direction in which to move that provides the best communication quality of service with the rest of the team. VBCP uses information about other robots, real-time quality of service measurements and an a priori map of the environment to approximate an optimal direction in an efficient manner. Here, VBCP maintains communication between members of a robotic team while traversing an urban environment in formation.

We study rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) as an example of graph-based techniques and the parti-game method as an example of cell-based techniques. We then propose partigame directed RRTs (PDRRTs) as a novel technique that combines them. PDRRTs are based on the parti-game method but use RRTs as local controllers rather than the simplistic controllers used by the parti-game method. Our experimental results show that PDRRTs plan faster and solve more motion-planning problems than RRTs and plan faster and with less memory than the parti-game method.

The development of a new coalition formation and coordination framework for robot colonies in dangerous, unknown and dynamic environment is outlined. The name of this new framework is Metaphor of Politics (MP), and it loosely takes inspiration from the political organizations of democratic governments. The main characteristic of the proposed framework lies in its dynamic reconfigurability in order to adapt the robot colony to environmental changes. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

This paper presents a speed control system for a robotic platform traveling over natural terrain. This system is based on the view of a line-scanning laser of the area just in front of the platform. Analysis of range data for roughness produced by the laser over different terrains is examined. An algorithm for managing speed through different terrain has been tested on real outdoor surfaces producing excellent performance. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Forgetting Bad Behavior: Memory Management for Case-Based Navigation"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "In this paper, we present successful strategies for forgetting cases in a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) system applied to autonomous robot navigation. This extends previous work that involved a CBR architecture , which indexes cases by the spatio-temporal characteristics of the sensor data, and outputs or selects parameters of behaviors in behavior-based robot architecture. In such a system, the removal of cases can be applied when a new situation unlike any current case in the library is encountered, but the library is full. Various strategies of determining which cases to remove are proposed, including metrics such as how frequently a case is used and a novel spreading activation mechanism. Experimental results show that such mechanisms can increase the performance of the system significantly and allow it to essentially forget old environments in which it was trained in favor of new environments it is currently encountering. The performance of this new system is better than both a purely reactive behavior-based system as well as the CBR module that did not forget cases. Furthermore, such forgetting mechanisms can be useful even when there is no major environmental shift during training, since some cases can potentially be harmful or rarely used. The relationship between the forgetting mechanism and the case library size is also discussed. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

The goal of this research is to achieve an optimal parameterization of robotic behaviors in run-time. This increases robot performance and makes a manual configuration of parameters unnecessary. The case-based reasoning module selects a set of parameters for an active behavioral assemblage in real-time. This set of parameters fits the environment better than hand-coded ones, and its performance is monitored providing feedback for a possible reselection of the parameters. This paper places a significant emphasis on the technical details of the casebased reasoning module and how it is integrated within a schemabased reactive navigation system.

		core:abstract "This paper investigates how the psychological notion of comfort can be useful in the design of robotic systems. A review of the existing study of human comfort, especially regarding its presence in infants, is conducted with the goal being to determine the relevant characteristics for mapping it onto the robotics domain. Focus is placed on the identification of the salient features in the environment that affect the comfort level. Factors involved include current state familiarity, working conditions, the amount and location of available resources, etc. As part of our newly developed comfort function theory, the notion of an object as a psychological attachment for a robot is also introduced, as espoused in Bowlby's theory of attachment. The output space of the comfort function and its dependency on the comfort level are analyzed. The results of the derivation of this comfort function are then presented in terms of the impact they have on robotic behavior. Justification for the use of the comfort function in the domain of robotics is presented with relevance for real-world operations. Also, a transformation of the theoretical discussion into a mathematical framework suitable for implementation within a behavior based control system is presented. The paper concludes with results of simulation studies and real robot experiments using the derived comfort function. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "We study a greedy mapping method that always moves the robot from its current location to the closest location that it has not visited (or observed) yet, until the terrain is mapped. Although one does not expect such a simple mapping method to minimize the travel distance of the robot, we present analytical results that show (perhaps surprisingly) that the travel distance of the robot is reasonably small. This is interesting because greedy mapping has a number of desirable properties. It is simple to implement and integrate into complete robot architectures. It does not need to have control of the robot at all times, takes advantage of prior knowledge about parts of the terrain (if available), and can be used by several robots cooperatively.

The schematic sowbug is based on Tolman's purposive behaviorism, and it is believed to be the rst prototype in history that actually implemented a behavior-based architecture suitable for robotics. The schematic sowbug navigates the environment based on two types of vectors, orientation and progression, that are computed from the values of sensors perceiving stimuli. Our experiments on both simulation and real robot proved the legitimacy of Tolman's assumptions, and the potential of applying the schematic sowbug model and principles within modern robotics is recognized.

		core:abstract "Partially Observable Markov Decision Process models (POMDPs) have been applied to low-level robot control. We show how to use POMDPs differently, namely for sensor planning in the context of behavior-based robot systems. This is possible because solutions of POMDPs can be expressed as policy graphs, which are similar to the finite state automata that behavior-based systems use to sequence their behaviors. An advantage of our system over previous POMDP navigation systems is that it is able to find close-to-optimal plans since it plans at a higher level and thus with smaller state spaces. An advantage of our system over behavior-based systems that need to get programmed by their users is that it can optimize plans during missions and thus deal robustly with probabilistic models that are initially inaccurate.

		core:abstract "This report provides a detailed study of the design of feasible human-robot interfaces for near- term deployment in a robot unit, defined as a tightly coupled group of humans using a multiplicity of robots as tactical tools. There is a strong relationship between three phases of fielding man-machine systems of this type: system design, operator selection, and operator training (Figure 1). Here we consider all of these dimensions, developing an understanding of the tradeoffs between highly-trained operators versus novice operators, the importance of specific cognitive and intellectual reasoning abilities of potential operators, and the impact of system design on all of this. Clearly, a sophisticated, well-designed system will require less training and enable a larger set of people to interact with it. The purpose of this study is to span this space of potential design and human factors issues and identify the inherent wins, losses, and trade-offs given the goal of rapidly fielding such a system.

		core:abstract "We analyze a model of neuronal mechanisms underlying amphibias prey-catching behavior, integrating hypotheses generated within different areas of Neuroscience and studying how the efficacy of visual prey-like dummies to release toads prey-catching actions depends on parallel distributed processes occurring at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. First, in the scale of 100s of msecs, changes in neuronal activity caused by the stimulus characteristics and its current spatial-temporal relationship with the toad, as well as nervous signals related to actions expected consequences (e.g., mouth mechanoreceptors activation after a snapping ); second, signals generated during learning events happening at a temporal scale of minutes to hours; third, signals related to the course of actions , within an undetermined time scale that may last for several hours; and fourth, signals generated by changes in motivational factors (e.g., hunger, daily and yearly cycles) occurring at a much slower time scale. In addition, we analyze how in this knowledge representation , the course of actions ( plan ) is episodic , goaloriented and can be modulated by learning, or by changes in the agent s motivational state . This modulation is the outcome of accommodating information of new situations (a non catchable prey-like stimulus) into the dynamics of underlying neuronal mechanisms, in order to change the way the toad ( agent) normally responds to that domain of interaction (stop yielding prey-catching behaviors towards that specific stimulus), without affecting its performance when similar situations appear in its immediate surroundings (prey-catching behaviors to real prey remain unchanged).

		core:abstract "In 1999, Georgia Tech conducted two field experiments to determine the performance of its mission specification system. The experiments were developed for the DARPA Tactical Mobile Robotics (TMR) Program and were conducted at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The goal of the TMR Program is to develop robotic tools that can perform useful tasks on future military missions involving complex obstacle negotiation, autonomous indoor navigation, and robust machine perception for urban environments. As a part of the program, Georgia Tech has been developing fault-tolerant multi-robot behaviors and a reusable mission-specification/user-interface system. Pioneer-AT robots were integrated with vision and sonar sensors, infrared proximity sensors, and differential global positioning system (DGPS) to achieve the goals of approaching and conducting an interior search of a hospital. The emphasis of these particular experiments was the practical implementation of schema-based behavioral control with the mission specification system when designed with the novice user in mind. This paper details the results obtained and lessons learned during those preliminary field trials. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Incremental heuristic search methods can often re-plan paths much faster than incremental or heuristic search methods individually, yet are simple to use. So far, they have only been used in mobile robotics to move a robot to given goal coordinates in unknown terrain. As far as we know, incremental heuristic search methods have not yet been applied to the problem of mapping unknown terrain. In this paper, we therefore describe how to apply our incremental heuristic search method D* Lite, that combines ideas from Lifelong Planning A* and Focussed D*, to mapping unknown terrain, which is rather nontrivial. We then compare its runtime against that of incremental search and heuristic search alone, demonstrating the computational benefits of their combination. By demonstrating the versatility and computational benefits of incremental heuristic search, we hope that this under exploited technique will be used more often in mobile robotics.

		core:abstract "Q-learning has often been used in robotics to learn primitive behaviors. However, the complexity of the algorithm increases exponentially with the number of states the robot can be in and the number of actions that it can take. Therefore, it is natural to try to reduce the number of states and actions in order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Robot behaviors and behavioral assemblages provide a good level of abstraction, which can be used to speed up robot learning. Instead of coordinating a set of primitive actions, we use Q-learning to coordinate a set of well-tested behavioral assemblages to accomplish a robotic target intercept mission.

		core:abstract "MissionLab is a mission specification system that implements a hybrid deliberative and reactive control architecture for autonomous mobile robots. The user creates and executes the robot mission plans through its graphical user interface. As robot deployments become more common in highly stressful situations, such as in dealing with explosives or biohazards, the usability of their mission specification system becomes critical. To address this need, a mission planning wizard has been recently integrated into MissionLab. By retrieving and adapting past successful mission plans stored in its database, this new feature is designed to simplify the users planning process. The latest formal usability experiments, reported in this paper, testing for usability improvements in terms of speed of the mission planning process, accuracy of the produced mission plans, and ease of use is conducted. This paper introduces the mission-planning wizard, describes the usability experiments (including design), and discusses the results in detail. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "We present an approach that uses Q-learning on individual robotic agents, for coordinating a missiontasked team of robots in a complex scenario. To reduce the size of the state space, actions are grouped into sets of related behaviors called roles and represented as behavioral assemblages. A role is a Finite State Automata such as Forager, where the behaviors and their sequencing for finding objects, collecting them, and returning them are already encoded and do not have to be relearned. Each robot starts out with the same set of possible roles to play, the same perceptual hardware for coordination, and no contact other than perception regarding other members of the team. Over the course of training, a team of Q-learning robots will converge to solutions that best the performance of a well designed handcrafted homogeneous team .

		core:title "Improved Fast Replanning for Robot Navigation in Unknown Terrain"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Mobile robots often operate in domains that are only incompletely known, for example, when they have to move from given start coordinates to given goal coordinates in unknown terrain. In this case, they need to be able to re-plan quickly as their knowledge of the terrain changes. Stentz Focussed Dynamic A* is a heuristic search method that repeatedly determines a shortest path from the current robot coordinates to the goal coordinates while the robot moves along the path. It is able to re-plan one to two orders of agnitudes faster than planning from scratch since it modifies previous search results locally. Consequently, it has been extensively used in mobile robotics. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to Focussed Dynamic A* that implements the same navigation strategy but is algorithmically different. Focussed Dynamic A* Lite is simpler, easier to understand, easier to analyze and easier to extend than Focussed Dynamic A*, yet is more efficient. We believe that our results will make D*-like re-planning algorithms even more popular and enable robotics researchers to adapt them to additional applications.

		core:abstract "We present a method for representing, communicating and fusing distributed, noisy and uncertain observations of an object by multiple robots. The approach relies on re-parameterization of the canonical two-dimensional Gaussian distribution that corresponds more naturally to the observation space of a robot. The approach enables two or more observers to achieve greater effective sensor coverage of the environment and improved accuracy in object position estimation. We demonstrate empirically that, when using our approach, more observers achieve more accurate estimations of an objects position. The method is tested in three application areas, including object location, object tracking, and ball position estimation for robotic soccer. Quantitative evaluations of the technique in use on mobile robots are provided. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

Use of CBR methodology in the selection of behavioral parameters has already shown significant improvement in robot performance [3, 6, 7, 14] as measured by mission completion time and success rate. It has also made unnecessary the manual configuration of behavioral parameters from a user. However, the choice of the library of CBR cases does affect the robot's performance, and choosing the right library sometimes is a difficult task especially when working with a real robot. In contrast, Learning Momentum does not depend on any prior information such as cases and searches for the &quot;right&quot; parameters in real-time. This results in high mission success rates and requires no manual configuration of parameters, but it shows no improvement in mission completion time [2]. This work combines the two approaches so that CBR discontinuously switches behavioral parameters based on given cases whereas LM uses these parameters as a starting point for the real-time search for the &quot;right&quot; parameters. The integrated system was extensively evaluated on both simulated and physical robots. The tests showed that on simulated robots the integrated system performed as well as the CBR only system and outperformed the LM only system, whereas on real robots it significantly outperformed both CBR only and LM only systems.

		core:title "Learning Behavioral Parameterization Using Spatio-Temporal Case-Based Reasoning"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "This paper presents an approach to learning an optimal behavioral parameterization in the framework of a Case-Based Reasoning methodology for autonomous navigation tasks. It is based on our previous work on a behavior-based robotic system that also employed spatio-temporal case-based reasoning [3] in the selection of behavioral parameters but was not capable of learning new parameterizations. The present method extends the case-based reasoning module by making it capable of learning new and optimizing the existing cases where each case is a set of behavioral parameters. The learning process can either be a separate training process or be part of the mission execution. In either case, the robot learns an optimal parameterization of its behavior for different environments it encounters. The goal of this research is not only to automatically optimize the performance of the robot but also to avoid the manual configuration of behavioral parameters and the initial configuration of a case library, both of which require the user to possess good knowledge of robot behavior and the performance of numerous experiments. The presented method was integrated within a hybrid robot architecture and evaluated in extensive computer simulations, showing a significant increase in the performance over a nonadaptive system and a performance comparable to a non-learning CBR system that uses a hand-coded case library.

		core:title "Learning Of Parameter-adaptive Reactive Controllers for Robotic Navigation"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Reactive controllers are widely used in mobile robots because they are able to achieve successful performance in real-time. However, the configuration of a reactive controller depends highly on the operating conditions of the robot and the environment; thus, a reactive configured for one class of environments may not perform adequately in another. This paper presents a formulation of parameter-adaptive reactive controllers. Parameter-adaptive reactive controllers inherit all the advantages of traditional reactive controllers, but in addition they are able to adjust themselves to the current operating conditions of the robot and the environment in order to improve task performance. Additionally, the paper describes a multistrategy learning algorithm that combines ideas from case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to construct a mapping between the operating conditions of the mobile robot and the appropriate controller configuration; this mapping is in turn used to adapt the controller configuration dynamically. The algorithm is implemented and evaluated in a robotic navigation system that controls a Denning MRV-III mobile robot. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

This enables the whole society to be affected as a group rather than forcing the operator to control each agent individually. The operator is viewed by the reactive control system as another behavior exerting his/her influence on the society as a whole. The operator can also control the overall personality of the robot group. Simulation results are presented for foraging, vacuuming, and herding tasks. Results on real robots are presented for maneuvering robots out of a box canyon and squeezing robots through a small space.

Actuators for steering, brake, and throttle have been implemented on a commercially available Hummer. Control is provided by on-board and remote computation includes a PC-based control computer coupled to feedback sensors for the steering wheel, brake, and forward speed; and a Unix workstation for high-level control. A radio link connects the on-board computers to an operators remote workstation running the Georgia Tech Mission Lab system.

		core:abstract "The days of specifying missions for mobile robots using traditional programming languages such as C++ and LISP are coming to an end. The need to support operators lacking programming skills coupled with the increasing diversity of robot run-time operating systems is moving the eld towards high-level robot programming toolsets which allow graphical mission specication. This paper explores the issues of evaluating such toolsets as to their usability. This article rst examines how usability criteria are established and performance target values chosen. The methods by which suitable experiments are created to gather data relevant to the usability criteria are then presented. Finally, methods to analyze the data gathered to establish values for the usability criteria are discussed. The MissionLab toolset is used as a concrete example throughout the article to ground the discussions, but the methods and techniques are generalizable to many such systems.

		core:abstract "As autonomous robots become more complex in their behavior, more sophisticated software architectures are required to support the ever more sophisticated robotics software. These software architectures must support complex behaviors involving adaptation and learning, implemented, in particular, by neural networks. We present in this paper a neural based schema [2] software architecture for the development and execution of autonomous robots in both simulated and real worlds. This architecture has been developed in the context of adaptive robotic agents, ecological robots [6], cooperating and competing with each other in adapting to their environment. The architecture is the result of integrating a number of development and execution systems: NSL, a neural simulation language; ASL, an abstract schema language; and MissionLab , a schema-based mission-oriented simulation and robot system. This work contributes to modeling in Brain Theory (BT) and Cognitive Psychology, with applications in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), Autonomous Agents and Robotics.

Their study, through both experimentation and computation, provides a means to understand the underlying mechanisms in living systems while inspiring the development of technological applications. Experimentation, consisting of data gathering, generates predictions to be validated by experimentation on artificial systems. Computational models provide the understanding for the underlying dynamics, and serve as basis for simulation and further experimentation. The work presented here involves analyzing how predictive models can be generated from biological systems and then be used to drive robotic experiments; and conversely, how can results from robotic experiments drive additional neuroethological data gathering.

The methodology developed for this work has been applied to multi-robot foraging. soccer and cooperative movement. This paper focuses specially on results in multi-robot foraging. In these experiments three types of reward are used with Q-learning to train a multi-robot team to forage a local performance based reward. a global performance based reward and a heuristic strategy referred to as shaped reinforcement . Local strate gies provide each agent a specie reward according to its own behavior, while global rewards provide all the agents on the team the same reward simultaneously. Shaped reinforcement provides a heuristic reward for an agents action given its situation. The experiments indicate that local performance based rewards and shaped reinforcement generate statistically similar results they both provide the best performance and the least diversity. Finally, learned policies are demonstrated on a team of Nomadic Technologies, Nomad robots. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Monte Carlo Localization for Mobile Robots"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know where it is. Thus, reliable position estimation is a key problem in mobile robotics. We believe that probabilistic approaches are among the most promising candidates to providing a comprehensive and real-time solution to the robot localization problem. However, current methods still face considerable hurdles. In particular, the problems encountered are closely related to the type of representation used to represent probability densities over the robots state space. Recent work on Bayesian filtering with particle-based density representations opens up a new approach for mobile robot localization, based on these principles. In this paper we introduce the M onte C arlo L ocalization method, where we represent the probability density involved by maintaining a set of samples that are randomly drawn from it. By using a sampling-based representation we obtain a localization method that can represent arbitrary distributions. We show experimentally that the resulting method is able to efficiently localize a mobile robot without knowledge of its starting location. It is faster, more accurate and less memory-intensive than earlier grid-based methods. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Using the CONDENSATION Algorithm for Robust, Vision-basedMobile Robot Localization"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know where it is. This includes both the ability of globally localizing the robot from scratch, as well as tracking the robots position once its location is known. Vision has long been advertised as providing a solution to these problems, but we still lack efficient solutions in unmodified environments. Many existing approaches require modification of the environment to function properly, and those that work within unmodified environments seldomly address the problem of global localization. In this paper we present a novel, vision-based localization method based on the C ONDENSATION algorithm [17, 18], a Bayesian filtering method that uses a sampling based density representation. We show how the C ONDENSATION algorithm can be used in a novel way to track the position of the camera platform rather than tracking an object in the scene. In addition, it can also be used to globally localize the camera platform, given a visual map of the environment. Based on these two observations, we present a vision based robot localization method that provides a solution to a difficult and open problem in the mobile robotics community. As evidence for the viability of our approach, we show both global localization and tracking results in the context of a state of the art robotics application.

The formation behaviors are integrated with other navigational behaviors to enable a robotic team to reach navigational goals, avoid hazards and simultaneously remain in formation. The behaviors are implemented in simulation, on robots in the laboratory and aboard DARPA's HMMWV-based Unmanned Ground Vehicles. The technique has been integrated with the Autonomous Robot Architecture (AuRA) and the UGV Demo II architecture. The results demonstrate the value of various types of formations in autonomous, human-led and communications-restricted applications, and their appropriateness in different types of task environments.

		core:abstract "Formal models of animal sensor motor behavior can provide effective methods for generating robotic intelligence. In this article we describe how schema-theoretic models of the praying mantis derived from behavioral and neuro-scientific data can be implemented on a hexapod robot equipped with a real-time color vision system. This implementation incorporates a wide range of behaviors, including obstacle avoidance, prey acquisition, predator avoidance, mating, and chantlitaxia behaviors that can provide guidance to neuroscientists, ethologists, and roboticists alike. The goals of this study are threefold: to provide an understanding and means by which elded robotic systems are not competing with other agents that are more effective at their designated task; to permit them to be successful competitors within the ecological system and capable of displacing less efficient agents; and that they are ecologically sensitive so that agent-environment dynamics are well-modeled and as predictable as possible whenever new robotic technology is introduced.

		core:title "Multiagent Telerobotics: Matching Systems to Tasks"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Amultiagent telerobotic system (MTS) is a system that allows a human to control a group of robots. Multiagent robotics has certain desirable properties when compared to single-agent robotics, and telerobotics has desirable properties when compared to autonomous robotics. Whether the combined eld of multiagent telerobotics will inherit those advantages, however, remains to be shown. Until now, no comparison of the performance of different multiagent telerobotic systems in terms of tasks has been conducted. Therefore, there were no guidelines to aid developers building a MTS for a particular task. This research compares the performance of different classes of mobile behavior- based multiagent telerobotics systems in relation to the kinds of tasks they are performing. The systems are compared in terms of safety, effectiveness, and ease-of-use, for applications representing classes of tasks in a newly developed taxonomy of mobile multiagent tasks. This taxonomy categorizes the tasks in terms of the relative motion of the agents. Four different task classifications from this taxonomy were studied. A methodology for evaluating the performance of robot systems for the tasks was adapted from standard experimental procedures, and a series of experiments was conducted, in which over a hundred human participants were used to control real robots. The end result of the experiments is a knowledge base relating the systems to the tasks. The systems were ranked in terms of their safety, effectiveness, and ease-of-use for each task. Additionally, where possible, more general results were identified, relating the type of system to the type of task. These results should guide future MTS developers to build safe, effective, and easy-to-use systems. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "A DESIGN METHODOLOGY FOR THE CONFIGURATION OF BEHAVIOR-BASED MOBILE ROBOTS"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Behavior-based robotic systems are becoming both more prevalent and more competent. However, operators lacking programming skills are still forced to use canned con gurations hand-crafted by experienced roboticists. This inability of ordinary people to specify tasks for robots is inhibiting the spread of robots into everyday life. Even expert roboticists are unable to share solutions in executable forms since there is no commonality of con guration descriptions. Further, a con guration commonly requires significant rework before it can be deployed on a different robot, even one with similar capabilities. The research documented in this dissertation attacks this problem from three fronts. First, the foundational Societal Agent theory is developed to describe how agents form abstract structures at all levels in a recursive fashion. It provides a uniform view of agents, no matter what their physical embodiment. Agents are treated consistently across the spectrum, from a primitive motor behavior to a con guration coordinating large groups of robots. The recursive nature of the agent construction facilitates information hiding and the creation of high-level primitives. Secondly, the MissionLab toolset is eveloped which supports the graphical con- struction of architecture- and robot-independent con gurations. This independence allows users to directly transfer designs to be bound to the speci c robots at the recipient's site. The assemblage construction supports the recursive construction of new coherent behaviors from coordinated groups of other behaviors. This allows users to build libraries of increasingly high-level primitives which are directly tailored to their needs. MissionLab support for the graphical construction of state-transition diagrams allows use of temporal sequencing to partition a mission into discrete operating states, with assemblages implementing each state. Support for multiple code generators (currently existing for AuRA and SAUSAGES) ensures that a wide variety of robots can be supported. Finally, speci c usability criteria for toolsets such as MissionLab are established. Three usability studies are de ned to allow experimental establishment of values for these criteria. The results of carrying out these studies using the MissionLab toolset are presented, con rming its bene ts over conventional techniques. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "A New Heuristic Approach for Dual Control"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Autonomous agents engaged in a continuous interaction with an incompletely known environment face the problem of dual control. Simply stated, actions are necessary not only for studying the environment, but also for making progress on the task. In other words, actions must bear a &quot;dual&quot; character: They must be investigators to some degree, but also directors to some degree. Because the number of variables involved in the solution of the dual control problem increases with the number of decision stages, the exact solution of the dual control problem is computationally intractable except for a few special cases. This paper provides an overview of dual control theory and proposes a heuristic approach towards obtaining a near-optimal dual control method that can be implemented. The proposed algorithm selects control actions taking into account the information contained in past observations as well as the possible information that future observations may reveal. In short, the algorithm anticipates the fact that future learning is possible and selects the control actions accordingly. The algorithm uses memory-based methods to associate long term benefit estimates to belief states and actions, and selects the actions to execute next according to such estimates. The algorithm uses the outcome of every experience to progressively refine the long term benefit estimates so that it can make better, improved decisions as it progresses. The algorithm is tested on a classical simulation problem. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Multiagent Mission Specification and Execution"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Specifying a reactive behavioral configuration for use by a multiagent team requires both a careful choice of the behavior set and the creation of a temporal chain of behaviors, which executes the mission. This difficult task is simplified by applying an object-oriented approach to the design of the mission using a construction called an assemblage and a methodology called temporal sequencing. The assemblage construct allows building high-level primitives which provide abstractions for the designer. Assemblages consist of groups of basic behaviors and coordination mechanisms that allow the group to be treated as a new coherent behavior. Upon instantiation, the assemblage is parameterized based on the specific mission requirements. Assemblages can be re-parameterized and used in other states within a mission or archived as high-level primitives for use in subsequent projects. Temporal sequencing partitions the mission into discrete operating states with perceptual triggers causing transitions the mission into discrete operating states with perceptual triggers causing transitions between those states. Several smaller independent configurations (assemblages) can then be created which each implement one state. The Societal Agent theory is presented as a basis for the constructions of this form. The Configuration Description Language (CDL) is developed to capture the recursive composition of configurations in an architecture and robot independent fashion. The MissionLab system, an implementation based on CDL, supports the graphical construction of configurations using a visual editor. Various multiagent missions are demonstrated in simulation and our Dennin robots using these tools. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Social Entropy: a new Metric for Learning Multi-robot Teams"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "As robotics research expands into multiagent tasks and learning, investigators need new tools for evaluating the artificial robot societies they study. Is it enough, for example, just to say a team is &quot;heterogeneous?&quot; perhaps heterogeneity is more properly viewed on a sliding scale. To address these issues this paper presents new metrics for learning robot teams. The metrics evaluate diversity in societies of mechanically similar but behaviorally heterogeneous agents. Behavior is and especially important dimension of diversity in learning teams since as they learn, agents choose between hetero- or homogeneity based solely on their behavior. This paper introduces metrics of behavioral difference and behavioral diversity. Behavioral difference refers to disparity between two specific agents, while diversity is a measured of an entire society. Social Entropy, inspired by Shannon's Information Entropy, is proposed as a metric of behavioral diversity. It captures important components of diversity including the number and size of castes in a society. The new metrics are illustrated in the evaluation of an example learning robot soccer team.

		core:abstract "This paper describes research investigating behavioral specialization in learning robot teams. Each agent is provided a common set of skills (motor schema- based behavioral assemblages) from which it builds a task-achieving strategy using reinforcement learning. The agents learn individually to activate particular behavioral assemblages given their current situation and a reward signal. The experiments, conducted in robot soccer simulations, evaluate the agents in terms of performance, policy convergence, and behavioral diversity. The results show that in many cases, robots will automatically diversify by choosing heterogeneous behaviors. The degree of diversification and the performance of the team depend on the reward structure. When the entire team is jointly rewarded or penalized (global reinforcement), teams tend towards heterogeneous behavior. When agents are provided feedback individually (local reinforcement, they converge to identical policies. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

The navigation module uses a schema-based reactive control system to perform the navigation task. The learning module combines case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to continuously tune the navigation system through experience. The case-based reasoning component perceives and characterizes the systems environment, retrieves an appropriate case, and uses the recommendations of the case to tune the parameters of the reactive control system. The reinforcement-learning component refines the content of the cases based on the current experience. Together, the learning components perform on-line adaptation, resulting in improved performance as the reactive control system tunes itself to the environment, as well as on-line case learning, resulting in an improved library of cases that capture environmental regularities necessary to perform on-line adaptation. The system is extensively evaluated through simulation studies using several performance metrics and system configurations. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Reactive control for mobile manipulation involves a tight coupling of sensors to motor response. Pseudo-forces exerted on the end-effector and limbs of the mobile manipulator must be distributed over the entire structure. Pseudo-joint damping provides a mechanism for this process. Damping functions were used to create motion of the end-effector, which emulated the characteristics of biological systems. The target biological characteristics were a general bell-shaped curve of the end-effector speed profile, an initial and final end-effector speed of zero, and a scaling of the speed profile with distance to goal. The damping functions were then evaluated for time, distance, safety, and flexibility to determine if the biological characteristics corresponded to improve performance of the mobile manipulator. The simulations showed that by reproducing the characteristics of biological systems, improved performance of the mobile manipulator was realized. The set of linear and square damping functions were found to perform best in a series of varying environments. Both damping functions were shown to produce different ending configurations of the arm, and to be more or less aggressive by varying the damping parameters in the functions. This allows the performance of the mobile manipulator to be adjusted based on any a priori information about the environment. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Knowledge Compilation and Speedup Learning"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Many techniques for speedup learning and knowledge compilation focus on the learning and optimization of macro-operators or control rules in task domains that can be characterized using a problem-space search paradigm. However, such a characterization does not fit well the class of task domains in which the problem solver is required to perform in a continuous manner. For example, in many robotic domains, the problem solver is required to monitor real-valued perceptual inputs and vary its motor control parameters in a continuous, on-line manner to successfully accomplish its task. In such domains, discrete symbolic states and operators are difficult to define. To improve its performance in continuous problem domains, a problem solver must learn, modify, and use continuous operators that continuously map input sensory information to appropriate control outputs. Additionally, the problem solver must learn the contexts in which those continuous operators are applicable. We propose a learning method that can compile sensorimotor experiences into continuous operators, which can then be used to improve performance of the problem solver. The method speeds up the task performance as well as results in improvements in the quality of the resulting solutions.

		core:abstract "This paper presents a self-improving reactive control system for autonomous robotic navigation. The navigation module uses a schema based reactive control system to perform the navigation task. The learning module combines case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to continuously tune the navigation system through experience. The case-based reasoning component perceives and characterizes the systems environment, retrieves an appropriate case, and uses the recommendations of the case to tune the parameters of the reactive control system. The reinforcement-learning component refines the content of the cases based on the current experience. Together, the learning components perform on-line adaptation, resulting in improved performance as the reactive control system tunes itself to the environment, as well as on-line learning, resulting in an improved library of cases that capture environmental regularities necessary to perform on-line adaptation. The system is extensively evaluated through simulation studies using several performance metrics and system configurations. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

GAO's research questions included (1) What are the current and potential uses and benefits of UASs? (2) What challenges exist in operating UASs safely and routinely in the national airspace system? and (3) What is the federal government's response to these challenges? To address these questions, GAO reviewed the literature, interviewed agency officials and aviation stakeholders, and surveyed 23 UAS experts."^^xsd:string ;

We present two important results: 1) Performance is improved significantly when CPU time allocated to individual navigational threads is adjusted dynamically according to a heuristic measure of their importance. 2) To implement this strategy, we present a multi-processor scheduler design, which can dynamically schedule navigational threads. The experiments were conducted in simulation on a BBN Butterfly and a KSR1 (shared memory multiprocessors). Speedups found for this example should extend to more complex navigational strategies as long as a heuristic measure of thread importance is available. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

Our approach evolves reactive control systems in various environments, thus creating sets of ecological niches that can be used in similar environments. The use of genetic algorithms as an unsupervised learning method for reactive control architecture greatly reduces the effort required configuring a navigation system. Unlike standard genetic algorithms, our method uses a floating-point gene representation. The system is fully implemented and has been evaluated through extensive computer simulations of robot navigation through various types of environments. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Multiple cooperating robots are able to complete many tasks more quickly and reliably than one robot alone. Communication between the robots can multiply their capabilities and effectiveness, but to what extent? In this research, the importance of communication in robotic societies is investigated through experiments on both simulated and real robots. Performance was measured for three different types of communication for three different tasks. The levels of communication are progressively more complex and potentially more expensive to implement. For some tasks, communication can significantly improve performance, but for others inter-agent communication is apparently unnecessary. In cases where communication helps, the lowest level of communication is almost as effective as the more complex type. The bulk of theses results are derived from thousands of simulations run with randomly generated initial conditions. The simulation results help determine appropriate parameters for the reactive control system which was ported for tests on Denning Mobile robots. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Specification and Execution of Multiagent Missions"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "Specifying a purely reactive behavioral configuration for use by a multi-agent team executing a mission requires both a careful choice of the behavior set and the creation of temporal chain behaviors, which executes the mission. This difficult task is simplified by applying an object-oriented approach to the design of sequences of behavioral configurations where a methodology called temporal sequencing is used to partition the mission into discrete operating states and enumerate the perceptual triggers, which cause transitions between those states. Several smaller independent configurations can be created with each implementing one state, completing one step in the sequence. When properly constructed, these configurations (assemblages) become high-level primitives reusable in subsequent projects, reducing development time. In the multi-vehicle domain being studied for the ARPA Demo II project, assemblages such as travel to location and occupy location consist of groups of basic behaviors associated with coordination mechanisms that allow the group to be treated as a single, coherent behavior. For example, travel to location consists of move to goal, avoid obstacle, avoid robot, noise, and stay in formation primitive behaviors moderated by a cooperative coordination operator. Upon instantiation, the assemblage is parameterized with a particular formation, goal location, and termination conditions. A mission coordination operator determines which assemblage to activate based upon the mission being executed and the current state of the system. A scenario language has been developed which allows specifying missions as sequences of steps, where each step invokes a particular assemblage. The missions are specified in a structured user-friendly language targeted for groups of cooperating robotic vehicles executing military-style scout missions. Various multi-agent missions have been demonstrated in simulation using this system. Deployment on Denning mobile robots demonstrated the utility of this mission execution system, while later deployment on the ARPA Demo II test platforms will ultimately allow comparisons with software developed using other methods.

The impact of each structured light system is analyzed in terms of their mechanical realization and the complexity of the image processing algorithms required for robust dent detection. The two design alternatives considered consist of projecting vertical or horizontal laser stripes on the drum surface. The first alternative favors image processing against. The results from simulated and real structured light systems are presented and their major advantages and disadvantages for dent detection are presented.

This new approach grew out of a dissatisfaction with existing methods for producing intelligent robotic response and a growing awareness of the importance of looking at biological systems as a basis for constructing intelligent behavior. Reactive robots are also referred to as behavior-based robots- they are instructed to perform through the activation of a collection of low-level primitive behaviors. Complex physical behavior emerges through the interaction of the behavioral set and the complexities of the environment in which the robot finds itself.

		core:abstract "New reactive behaviors that implement formations in multi-robot teams are presented and evaluated. These motor schemas, or primitive behaviors, for relative positional maintenance are integrated with existing navigational behaviors to help robots complete navigational tasks while in formation. Four formations, based on existing military doctrine (Army 1986), and three methods for determining correct vehicle position are investigated. The performance of a group of four simulated robots using this technique is evaluated quantitatively for both turning and for navigational across an obstacle field. These team behaviors will ultimately be fielded on four military vehicles as part of ARPAs UGY Demo II program. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

The algorithm exploits a physical model of the ultrasonic beam and combines several readings to extract outline object segments from the environment. It then detects patterns of outline segments that correspond to predefined models of object contours, performing both object recognition and localization. The algorithm is robust since it can account for noise and inaccurate readings as well as efficient since it uses a relaxation technique that can incorporate new data incrementally without recalculating from scratch.

		core:abstract "The definition for an intelligent robot has been: A machine that is able to extract information from its environment and use knowledge about its world to move safely in a meaningful and purposeful manner. There are others that would add to this definition. Schank requires that learning be a requisite part of any artificially intelligent system. Arbib adds world model maintenance and planning capabilities. While it is agreed that these are potentially useful additions, they are not defining characteristics. It is rather the active participation of a robotic agent with its world ( not just a simulation) that makes a robot a robot. This moves a large burden to the perceptual and motor control aspects of the robotic system, an area often neglected by those in mainstream artificial intelligence. Indeed it is our premise that without a thorough understanding of a robotic agents ecological relationships, it is impossible to effectively construct an intelligent robotic system. The notion of thus viewing a robot as inseparable from its environment is central to this position and is consistent with views from a biological/psychological perspective.

		core:abstract "This paper describes an implementation of a behavior-based mobile manipulator capable of autonomously transferring a sample from one drum to a second in unstructured environments. A major contribution of the project was the coherent integration of the arm and base as a cohesive unit, and not just a mobile base with an arm attached. The support for smooth simultaneous operation of all joints on the vehicle facilitated biologically plausible motions, such as arm preshaping. The behavior-based controller used a pseudo-force model, where behaviors add forces and torques to joints and limbs resulting in coordinated motion. The vehicle Jacobian is used to convert the pseudo-forces into joint torques and a pseudo-damping model converts the joint torques into joint velocities. This process allows rapid control of the manipulator without the use of inverse kinematics. A drum-sampling task is presented where the vehicle demonstrates how a sample of material could be moved from one drum to another, illustrating the efficacy of the solution.

		core:title "Experiments with Reinforcement Learning in Problems with Continuous State and Action Spaces"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "A key element in the solution of reinforcement learning problems is the value function. The purpose of this function is to measure the long-term utility or value of any given state and it is important because an agent can use it to decide what to do next. A common problem in that the value function must operate with a domain consisting of real-valued variables, which means that it should be able to represent the value of infinitely many state action pairs. For this reason, function approximators are used to represent the value function when a close-form solution of the optimal policy is not available. In this paper, we extend a previously proposed reinforcement learning algorithm so that it can be used with function approximators that generalize the value of individual experiences across both state and action spaces. In particular, we discuss the benefits of using sparse coarse-coded function approximators to represent value functions we describe in detail three implementations: CMAC, instance-based, and case-based. Additionally, we discuss how function approximators having different degrees of resolution in different regions of the state and action spaces may influence the performance and learning efficiency of the agent. We propose a simple and modular technique that can be used to implement function approximators with non-uniform degrees of resolution so that it can represent the value function with higher accuracy in important regions of the state and action spaces. We performed extensive experiments in the double integrator and pendulum swing up systems to demonstrate the proposed ideas. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:title "Towards Cosmopolitan Robots: Intelligent Navigation In Extended Man-Made Enviroments"^^xsd:string ;
		core:abstract "In the past, mobile robots have been constrained to operate in either an indoor or an outdoor environment, not both. Special purpose representations and ad hoc sensor techniques geared towards tasks of narrow focus have dominated these efforts. It is the purpose of this dissertation to lead towards the development of a more cosmopolitan robot; one whose domain of interaction is not as restricted as these previous attempts. The Autonomous Robot Architecture (AuRA) has been developed to meet these challenges. A meadow map, used for global path planning and containing embedded a priori knowledge to guide sensor expectations, serves as the robots long term memory. A layered short-term memory based on instantiated meadows represents the currently perceived world. Hierarchical path planner produces a global path free of collisions with all modeled obstacles. Schema theory is extended to include the mobile robot domain and serves as the principal theoretical framework. The schema-based path execution system handles unexpected and dynamic obstacles not present in the robots world model. This motor schema-based navigation system produces reactive/reflexive behavior in direct response to sensor events. In addition, new techniques in the treatment of robot uncertainty, which expedite sensory processing, are presented. These include the use of a spatial error map with associated error growth and reduction techniques. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

This overall docking behavior causes the robot to move to a workstation and park in an appropriate the robot to n area near the dock where the recognition of the dock triggers the slower, more accurate orienting motion for the final positioning. The ballistic motion is supported with two simple low-level behaviors: a phototropic (light seeking) behavior and a temporal (motion) detection behavior. The phototropic or temporal activity perceptual strategy maneuvers the vehicle toward the bright light or the abundant motion usually associated with workstations. These vision algorithms have been selected because strict knowledge of the initial position of the dock is not needed and each requires limited computational resources. This system has been implemented and shown to successfully generate ballistic motion in support of socking in typical manufacturing environments. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) that incorporate transport robots are currently dominated by the use of automatic guided vehicles. Theses AGVs generally require significant restructuring of the workplace in order for them to be useful. The concept of flexibility in manufacturing is somewhat compromised by this strategy. Our previous work in mobile robots, resulting in the Autonomous Robot Architecture (AuRA). Is applied to the manufacturing domain. This approach, contrary to the AGV methodology, embeds significant amounts of knowledge (both environmental and behavioral) to ultimately give mobile robot far greater latitude in interacting with its environment. This paper presents the motivation and subsequent simulation studies that demonstrate the feasibility of migrating schema-based navigation into an FMS. In particular, the creation of a docking motor schema to accomplish interaction with the workplace is detailed. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Landmark recognition is a task required of many robotic systems. In this work, we examine the use of a constrained Hough transform used by a mobile robot to locate a docking workstation. This algorithm deals with the uncertainty inherent in a mobile robot by making use of a spatial uncertainty map maintained by the robot. Several iterations of the Hough transform are run with transformed models of the dock. Votes are accumulated in a collapsed Hough space, which, although unable to recover range and orientation information, simplifies locating the dock within the image.

The new system (ACBARR-A Case BAsed Reactive Robotic System) provides more flexible performance in novel environments, as well as overcoming a standard hard problem for reactive systems, the box canyon. Additionally, ACBARR is designed in a manner, which is intended to remain close to pure reactive control as possible. Higher-level reasoning and memory functions are intentionally kept to a minimum. As a result, the new reasoning does not significantly slow the system down from pure reactive speeds. For more information refer to:"^^xsd:string ;

		core:abstract "Action-oriented perception provides an alternative to traditional high-level image understanding for the roboticist. By channeling sensory perception directly to motor behaviors (sensor fission) without mediating global representations rapid response is ensured. Forcing sensor fusion to be conducted within the context of motor needs reduces computational demand and enhances parallelism. Utilizing the correct visual algorithm to support motor action at the correct time (temporal coordination or sensor fashion) provides robust performance over wide ranges of activity. In this paper we describe the philosophy of action-oriented perception for the roboticist and discuss the different dimensions in which it may be effectively.
